 * Everyone is dealt two private cards, and five cards are placed in a shared space on the table.

 * After the initial betting round, there is one round of betting after each card is dealt to the table.

 * The player with the best hand based on their private cards and the shared cards on the table wins the pot.

 * If the player with the strongest hand at the end of the betting rounds bets and everyone else folds
   (meaning they stop betting and forfeit their cards), the winning player takes the pot without revealing their cards.

 * Each hand is different, and the rules and strategies of poker can vary depending on the type of poker being played.
